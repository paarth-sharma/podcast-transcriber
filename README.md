# Podcast-Transcriber

## A pet project I made on a whim, just because

This is **Vue js** project that uses **Supabase** on the backend to manage the authentication and user data 
and **Deepgram** to transcribe the podcast to text 

### Current features:
- User podcast history.
- Podcast transcribing to text.
- Reading rss feed of the said podcast to fetch details.
- User authentication via e-mail and MagicLink.

### Future scope/features:
- add a recommendation feature based on user activity.
- better frontend.

## How to run
installing the node dependecies (do this in the root of the repo)
```
npm install
```

type the following commands, navigate to ```src``` folder first
```
cd src
npm run dev
```
