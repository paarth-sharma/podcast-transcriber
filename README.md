# Podcast-Transcriber

## A pet project I made on a whim, just because

This is **Vue js** project that uses **Supabase** on the backend to manage the authentication and user data 
and **Deepgram** to transcribe the podcast to text 

### Current features:
- User podcast history.
- Podcast transcribing to text.
- Reading rss feed of the said podcast to fetch details.
- User authentication via e-mail and MagicLink.

### Future scope/features:
- add a recommendation feature based on user activity.
- better frontend.
